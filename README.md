# Klinkenberg-Effect
To evaluate the slip phenomenon and the Klinkenberg effect, it is necessary to at least measure the gas permeability at two mean-pressure levels. In the absence of such data
John's Equation to calculate b from permeability of Liquid itself, b = 6.9 kL ** −0.36. From this equation and original permeability equation, Kog = Kl + b * Kl * Pmo_inverse. 
we obtain an equation 6.9*Kl**0.64+Pm*Kl−Pm*Kg = 0, using Newton Raphson Method we obatin Kl value. Then I plotted the curve of Kog using Pm and Kl values to find the tentative 
slippage effect.
